 # Game Description
 
 Python 3 is required.

When the game begins a fleet of alien ships will appear at the top of the screen and move across and down the screen. Once an alien fleet is destroyed a new fleet will appear. Each new alien fleet is faster than the last. If an alien reaches the bottom of the screen the player will lose a ship. Once the player loses all three ships, the game is over.
